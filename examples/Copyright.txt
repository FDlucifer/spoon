Copright - ASCII graphics with a hidden message

The original image came from an internet newsgroup. If it's yours
please step forward!

On a serious point, however, you could encrypt your name/handle/nick
into an ASCII art image, and no one would know. Not only would they have
to know that there was a message in the text, they would also need to 
know the values for '0' and '1'. In this example, I've kept them as '0'
and '1' to make a point.
